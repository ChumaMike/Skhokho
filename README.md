# 🧠 Skhokho – Your Everyday Personal Life Helper

**Skhokho** is a mobile-friendly Flask app designed to help with everyday life tasks — starting with a unique tool used in South African taxis called **Balaa**.

Skhokho is being built in collaboration with **ChatGPT** through a hands-on, iterative approach — aka **vibe coding sessions** — where ideas are tested and refined in real time. 💡
